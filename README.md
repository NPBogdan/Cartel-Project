The Cartel is a site where people can tell if they have encountered an antisocial act in a certain city. To create the application I used the Laravel framework, Bootstrap to add a little style and I used an API from GoogleMaps (JavaScript). I used the benefits that Laravel offers such as ORM (Eloquent) , its facades (Auth, Session). I used Blade to better structure the view and sometimes to display certain information from the database. I followed the pattern of CRUD and I used as much as possible the commands provided by CLI Artisan.
